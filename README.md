# Downgen PHP

Downgen is on-air markdown documentation parser.

## Why Downgen?
I was really bored always commiting my project documentation written in markdown to project repo when I wanted to see how it looks. For this reason I wrote Downgen. And I really wanted simple and clean design.

## How it works
You setup your documentation directory and Downgen will parse directory structure as navigation, then you can browse your .MD files. When you try to access your page Downgen will parse it and display as HTML page.

## How to use Downgen?
You have to clone this repository to your project documentation directory and create index.php file.

Or you can use this one and customize it.

File `index.php` in your doc directory should look like this one:

```
<?php

	require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/downgen-master/Downgen.php");

	$generator = new Downgen(dirname(__FILE__));
	$generator->cssUrl = "/downgen-master/downgen.css";
	$generator->indexName = "README";
	$generator->render();

?>
```

Yep, thats all.

## Navigation page names
Page and directory title is filename without .md extension and underscores with dashed are replaced by spaces.

You can also number your files due to file ordering in following format and numbers will be removed: `01__First page`.

For example:

- `Page.md` = `Page`
- `My_page.md` = `My page`
- `My-page.md` = `My page`
- `01__First-page` = `First page`

## Hidden pages and directories
Pages or directories prefixed with `.` or `_`  are hidden from navigation tree.
